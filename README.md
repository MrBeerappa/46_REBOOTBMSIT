‚ú® Core Features
Sentinel-AI is equipped with a suite of powerful features designed for modern productivity and automation. The feature set is built to be both highly functional and easily extensible.

üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Command Interface: Interact with your OS using natural, conversational language. Sentinel-AI features state-of-the-art Speech-to-Text (STT) to accurately understand your spoken commands and lifelike Text-to-Speech (TTS) for audible feedback and responses. This creates a seamless, hands-free conversational experience, moving beyond the traditional constraints of command-line interaction.

üß† Multi-Agent Orchestration Engine: At its core, Sentinel-AI utilizes a sophisticated orchestration engine that intelligently delegates tasks to specialized agents. When a complex command is received, the orchestrator analyzes the user's intent, breaks the request down into a logical sequence of sub-tasks, and assigns each sub-task to the most appropriate agent or tool. This modular design, inspired by advanced AI frameworks, allows it to handle complex, multi-step workflows that a monolithic script could not, such as "Find the latest project summary in my downloads, draft an email to the project team with the summary attached, and schedule a follow-up meeting for Friday."

üîß Extensible OS Automation Toolkit: Go beyond simple commands with a rich set of built-in tools for real-world productivity. This toolkit is designed to be a practical foundation for day-to-day tasks, with the ability for developers to easily add more. Initial capabilities include:

Email Management: Compose and send emails through your configured personal or work account directly from the command line or via voice command.

Calendar & Meeting Scheduling: Instantly create Google Meet events, schedule appointments in your calendar, and invite attendees without opening a browser.

Hardware Control: Programmatically toggle system-level settings like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, useful for quick environment changes or script-based power management.

File System Operations: Execute advanced file operations, such as searching for documents based on content or metadata, organizing files into directories, and performing routine system cleanup.

üîê Secure Credential Management: Security is a foundational principle of Sentinel-AI. The agent integrates securely with your system's environment variables or a dedicated secrets vault to manage API keys, passwords, and other sensitive credentials. This practice ensures that your private information is never hard-coded into the source code or exposed in logs, adhering to security best practices seen in enterprise-grade applications.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
Understanding the architecture of Sentinel-AI is key for both advanced users and developers looking to contribute. The system is designed for modularity, scalability, and ease of extension.

Design Philosophy
Sentinel-AI is built on a modular, decoupled architecture. The core principle is the separation of concerns, which ensures that each component of the system has a distinct and well-defined responsibility. The command-understanding layer is distinct from the task-planning layer, which is in turn distinct from the tool-execution layer. This layered approach provides several key advantages:

Extensibility: Developers can add new tools or agents without modifying the core orchestration logic.

Maintainability: Isolating components makes debugging and updates significantly easier.

Scalability: The architecture allows for individual components to be scaled or replaced independently. For instance, the LLM provider could be swapped, or the STT engine upgraded, with minimal impact on the rest of the system.

This design is informed by patterns observed in other complex AI systems, such as the distributed nature of projects that separate coordinator nodes from execution nodes. While Sentinel-AI may begin as a single application, its architecture is prepared for a potential evolution towards a more distributed, microservices-style deployment if future complexity demands it.

Component Breakdown
The logical flow of a command through the Sentinel-AI system involves several key components working in concert:

Input Handler: This is the entry point for all user interaction. It is responsible for capturing input, whether from the command-line interface (CLI) as text or from a microphone as audio. In voice mode, this component manages the entire Speech-to-Text (STT) process, converting spoken words into a normalized text string. This string is then passed to the Core Orchestrator for processing.

Core Orchestrator (The "Brain"): This is the central nervous system of Sentinel-AI. It receives the normalized command from the Input Handler and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform two critical functions: intent recognition and task planning. It first determines the user's ultimate goal and then breaks down the request into a sequence of discrete, actionable steps. For each step, it consults the Agent & Tool Registry to select the most suitable capability.

Agent & Tool Registry: This component serves as a comprehensive directory of all available capabilities within Sentinel-AI. It makes a distinction between two types of capabilities:

Tools: Simple, stateless functions designed to perform a single, atomic action (e.g., send_email, set_bluetooth_state). They receive inputs, perform their function, and return a result.

Agents: More complex, potentially stateful workers designed for multi-step tasks that may require memory or context from previous steps.

Execution Engine: Once the Core Orchestrator has formulated a plan and selected the necessary tools, the Execution Engine is responsible for invoking them. It securely retrieves any required parameters (like API keys) and passes them to the tool, executes the function, and captures the output.

Output Handler: This is the final component in the workflow. It receives the result from the Execution Engine, formats it for human consumption, and presents it back to the user. This can be a simple text message printed to the console or an audible response generated by the Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Sentinel-AI is constructed using a carefully selected stack of modern, powerful technologies chosen for their performance, robustness, and strong community support. The technologies are categorized by their role within the system.

Core
Language: Python (3.10+ recommended)

Package & Environment Manager: The project uses Pip with venv for dependency management. This is a standard and reliable choice for Python projects, though alternatives like UV, noted for its speed, could also be adopted.

AI & Machine Learning
Orchestration/Agents: (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, or a custom implementation). This layer is responsible for the "thinking" part of the agent.

LLM Provider: (e.g., OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Google Gemini, or a locally-hosted model via Ollama). The choice of LLM directly impacts the agent's reasoning and planning capabilities.

Speech-to-Text (STT): (e.g., OpenAI Whisper, AssemblyAI, Google Speech-to-Text). A high-accuracy STT model is crucial for a reliable voice interface.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): (e.g., Coqui TTS, ElevenLabs API, Google Text-to-Speech). A natural-sounding TTS engine enhances the conversational feel of the agent.

Framework & APIs
Backend API (Optional): If the agent exposes an API for remote control, a lightweight framework like FastAPI or Flask would be used. FastAPI is particularly well-suited due to its automatic generation of interactive API documentation.

External Service APIs: The agent integrates with various third-party APIs to perform its tasks, such as the Google Gmail API and Google Calendar API.

Databases & Storage
Vector Database (Optional): For advanced features like long-term memory or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on local documents, a vector database is required (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone). This is a common pattern in advanced AI agents that need to reference external knowledge.

Configuration Management: Pydantic-Settings is used for managing environment variables, allowing for type-safe and easily validated configuration.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Configuration
Follow these steps carefully to install and configure Sentinel-AI on your local machine. A correct setup, especially of the environment variables, is crucial for the agent to function properly.

1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

Python (version 3.10 or newer)

Git for cloning the repository

An audio input device (microphone) if you plan to use the voice interaction mode.

2. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project and navigate into the directory:

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is a strong best practice to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies from your global Python installation. This prevents version conflicts and ensures a reproducible environment.

On macOS and Linux:

On Windows:

..venv\Scripts\activate
```
You will know the environment is active when you see (.venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

4. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file. This file lists all the libraries the project depends on.

5. Configure Environment Variables
This is the most critical step of the installation process. Sentinel-AI requires API keys and other configuration settings to connect to external services like LLM providers and Google APIs. The project uses a .env file to manage these secrets securely.

First, copy the example environment file to create your own local configuration file:

Next, open the newly created .env file in a text editor. You must fill in the values for the required variables. IMPORTANT: The .env file contains sensitive information. It is already listed in the .gitignore file, and you must NEVER commit it to version control.

The following table details the environment variables you need to configure. This structured approach to configuration is a standard practice for applications that require external credentials, ensuring that settings are managed explicitly and securely.

üöÄ Usage & Command Reference
Once Sentinel-AI is installed and configured, you can interact with it in several ways.

Interactive Voice Mode
This is the primary and most powerful way to use Sentinel-AI. In this mode, the agent actively listens for your spoken commands and provides audible feedback.

To start the agent in voice mode, run the following command from the project's root directory:

Wait for the agent to initialize and display a message like [INFO] Sentinel-AI is listening.... Once you see this, you can speak your command clearly.

Example Voice Commands:

"Hey Sentinel, send an email to Jane Doe at jane.doe@example.com. The subject is 'Project Update' and the body is 'Hi Jane, just wanted to let you know the project is on track for our deadline.'"

"Sentinel, create a Google Meet named 'Urgent Sync' for tomorrow at 10 AM with john.smith@example.com."

"Turn my Bluetooth off."
